{% admonition type="info" name="Attention" %}

_AMMClawback functionality is part of the proposed [XLS-73d](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/212) extension to the XRP Ledger protocol. You can test this feature on the Devnet test network, but there isn't an official amendment and it isn't available on the production Mainnet. Until there is an amendment, the details documented on this page are subject to change._
