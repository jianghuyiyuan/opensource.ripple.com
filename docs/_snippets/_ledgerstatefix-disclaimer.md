{% admonition type="info" name="Attention" %}

_LedgerStateFix is part of the proposed [fixNFTokenPageLinks](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4945) extension to the XRP Ledger protocol. You can test the transaction on test networks for now, but there isn't an official amendment and the feature is not available on the production Mainnet yet. Until there is an amendment in a stable release, the details documented on these pages are subject to change frequently._ <!-- SPELLING_IGNORE: 33d -->
