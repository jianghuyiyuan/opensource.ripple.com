# PaymentChannelFund

The only substantive change to this topic is to replace "XRP" with "XRP or fungible tokens" and the definition of an `Amount` as an Object or String.

For the full draft topic in context, see [https://xrpl-dev-portal--token-payment-channels-and-escrows.preview.redocly.app/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/paymentchannelfund](https://xrpl-dev-portal--token-payment-channels-and-escrows.preview.redocly.app/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/paymentchannelfund).
