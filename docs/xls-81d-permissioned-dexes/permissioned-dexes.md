# Permissioned DEXes

Permissioned DEXes are controlled environments for trading within the XRP Ledger's decentralized exchange (DEX). Trading in permissioned DEXes works like regular DEX trades, except that a [Permissioned Domain](../xls-80d-permissioned-domains/index.page.tsx) controls who can place and accept offers.
